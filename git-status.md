# Definition: git status
When using the terminal, you can use git status to get the status of your git repo. It will show you which branch you are currently at (if you have multiple branches), and if your branch is up to date and has anything to commit.
It will also show the untracked, changed, and staged files.

When using JupyterLab IDE, you can view the information by clicking the git icon on the left sidebar, locating your repo and viewing the inforamtion under "Changes".
